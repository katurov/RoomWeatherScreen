# Letters casse generator

This will generate lots of files with letters. One file per character. You should rename "dot", "dash" and "percent" files to not confuse the code. And put these files into the [C-code generator](https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/). 

Note:
 1. Background color: black
 2. Invert image colors: No
 3. Brightness / alpha threshold: 254
 4. Draw mode: Horizontal two bytes per pixel

Put code into [images.h](https://github.com/katurov/RoomWeatherScreen/blob/main/ArduinoIDE/images.h)
